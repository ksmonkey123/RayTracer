Camera setting by LaV (pitch provided externally)

given: LaV - vector from camera position to a point to be in the center of the
screen. It is expected to be normalized.

LaV = (x y z) , x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1

Therefore:

  - since the yaw transformation is the last one to be performed, its value is
     not influenced by other transformations. therefore the yaw angle can be
     directly determined from the LaV.
     
        yaw = acos[ norm{(x 0 z)} * (0 0 1) ]
        
  - by zeroing the x component a vector in the YZ plane is generated. This new
     vector however is no longer normalized and the pitch angle is falsified.
     By correcting the z component such that the vector is normalized again,
     the original pitch value can be recovered.
     
        z' = sqrt( 1 - y^2 )
        
        pitch = acos[ (0 y z') * (0 0 1) ]
        
  - the roll component is provided exernally and can directly be converted into
     a rotation matrix.
